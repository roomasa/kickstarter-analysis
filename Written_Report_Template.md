# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Reviewing outcomes of different fund-raising campaigns
### Purpose
To know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges
In order to evaluate campaigns based on launch dates, I created pivot tables and chart to visualize the data. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The line chart shows the number of successful campaigns by month. The number of successful outcomes peaked in May and were lowest in December with a gradual decline in numbers between May and Decemeber. The number of failed outcomes were relatively stable throughout the year ranging from a minimum of 31 (in Nov) to a maximum of  52 (in May). The number of canceled campaigns was seady and remained below 10 throughout the year 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The percentage of successsful outcomes steadily declined as the goal increased from $1000 to 34,999 and then increased for the 34,999-44,999 range and then dropped. The percentage of failed campaigns steadily increased as the goal increased from 1,000 to 29, 999, follwed by a decline between the 29,999 and 44,999 range and then increased again beyond 49, 999. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) Campaigns launced between May-September are most successful. 
2) very few campaigns are cancelled
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
As the Goal increases the percentage of successful campaigns seems to decrease
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
