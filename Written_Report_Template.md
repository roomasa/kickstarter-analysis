# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The project is evaluating different fund-raising projects to help Louise make informed decisions regaridng her own fundraising campaign. 
### Purpose
To specifically evaluate how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges
In order to evaluate campaigns based on launch dates, I created pivot tables and chart to visualize the data. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The line chart shows the number of successful campaigns by month. The number of successful outcomes peaked in May and were lowest in December with a gradual decline in numbers between May and Decemeber. The number of failed outcomes were relatively stable throughout the year ranging from a minimum of 31 (in Nov) to a maximum of  52 (in May). The number of canceled campaigns was seady and remained below 10 throughout the year 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The percentage of successsful outcomes steadily declined as the goal increased from $1000 to 34,999 and then increased for the 34,999-44,999 range and then dropped. The percentage of failed campaigns steadily increased as the goal increased from 1,000 to 29, 999, follwed by a decline between the 29,999 and 44,999 range and then increased again beyond 49, 999. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges in comparing data across countries is that the goals and pledged amounts are in different currencies making it hard to compare data across countries. One of the ways to address this is to standardize everything into one currency e.g. US dollars or to simply observe the trends rather than the actual values. 
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) Campaigns launced between May-September are most successful. 
2) Very few campaigns are cancelled
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
As the Goal increases the percentage of successful campaigns seems to decrease
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We do not know how the data were collected. Was there any reporting bias. Were successful campaigns more likely to be reported compared to failed ones and vice versa. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could also look at outcomes by country (create a bar chart for different countries), by the number of backers (line chart with backers on the x-axis and percentage of successful/failed/canceled campaigns on the y-axis). 
If we found any associations we could devle further to explore e.g. why certain campaigns were more successful in certain countries and whether campaigns followed the same trends associated with Launch Date in other countries as well.
